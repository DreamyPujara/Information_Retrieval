Learning Outcome: After completing this assignment you will be able to preprocess your documents
before performing IR tasks and also create inverted index.
1 Problem description

Data preprocessing is an essential step for building robust and reliable machine learning models. In IR, prepro-
cessing consists of a pipeline which converts the corpus into a format that allows a model to efficiently solve a

given task.
2 Implemetation
2.1 Dataset
• We will use Huggingface ILSUM English train dataset.
• To install the dataset: pip install dataset
• Follow the steps mentioned in the link to access the Article field of the dataset.
2.2 Exercise
1. Perform tokenization on a single article. [2 marks]
(a) Use word tokenize of NLTK library to tokenize the words and display the tokens.
(b) Use tiktoken to tokenize, display the subword tokens.
2. Convert the text to lowercase of a single article. [1 mark]
3. Remove stop-words from the text of a single article and display the words. [1 mark]
4. Perform stemming using Porter stemmer of the words of a single article and display the words. [1 mark]
5. Preprocess the Article fields of all the train data and then create Inverted Index. Display the inverted the
index for a few words. [5 mark]
