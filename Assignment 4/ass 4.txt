Learning Outcome: After this assignment you will learn how to implement a retrieval module using
PyTerrier and also how to evaluate it.
1 Problem description
In document retrieval the documents and queries are converted to vector space and then some matching is done
between the documents and queries. Which returns a ranked list of documents. Then evaluation is performed
to determine the efficiency the matching function.
2 Implementation
2.1 Dataset
• For this assignment we will use Gujarat Samachar news articles, which is in XML format. It contains news
on different categories for the year 2004 to 2010. You can download the dataset from this link: Dataset
Click
• The Queries are in ”gu.topics.176-225.2012”. The query is of the format shown in Figure 1. Use the
sentences enclosed in desc tag for framing your query vector
• The ”gu.qrels.176-225.2012-v1.txt” contains the documents that are relevant to a query. The format of a
qrel is such: Query No Q0 Document ID Relevance score.
• Relevance score is binary 0 or 1. 1 is for relevant, 0 is for otherwise.
• The documents in the dataset is in the format shown in Figure 2.
